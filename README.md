## Portfolio Website 👩‍💻

Welcome to my 🌟 portfolio website! This is a work in progress, but I'm excited to share my journey as a student 📚, XR creative student at Hyper Island 🚀, and self-taught frontend developer 💻 with you. You can check out the current version of my site [here](https://nabreu22.github.io/Portfolio/).

## Overview 📝

This website showcases my skills and projects as a frontend developer while highlighting my journey as a student at Hyper Island. Here are some of the key techniques and technologies I've used to create this site:

- **HTML & CSS**: The foundation of web development. I've used HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling, including responsive design.

- **Responsive Design**: My site is designed to work well on various screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to mobile devices. I've used media queries to ensure a smooth user experience across all devices.

- **Navigation**: The navigation menu allows users to easily access different sections of the site. I've implemented a mobile-friendly menu that toggles when needed.

- **Image Optimization**: To ensure fast loading times, I've optimized images used on the site to minimize file sizes without sacrificing quality.

- **Icons**: I've used Ionicons to add attractive and functional icons to the site.

- **Form**: There's a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with me. It's a work in progress, and I'll be adding functionality to it in the future.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

I'm actively working on improving this portfolio website. Here are some upcoming features I plan to add:

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: I'll be incorporating JavaScript to enhance user interactions and add dynamic features to the site.

- **Project Showcase**: I'll be expanding the portfolio section to showcase more of my projects with detailed descriptions and links.

- **Blog or Articles**: I'm considering adding a blog or articles section to share my insights and experiences as a student and frontend developer.
